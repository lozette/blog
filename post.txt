When I first walked into Bethnal Green Weightlifting Club in 2009 I had no idea what powerlifting really was, or that it would become such a big part of my life. Back then I was one of maybe 2 or 3 powerlifters there, plus maybe 2 or 3 weightlifters. In the 7 years since, powerlifting has exploded in popularity among women. In 2011 I was one of three women who took part in the British Powerlifting's (then known as the GBPF) All-England Championships; in 2016 the women's event is being held separately to the men's as there just isn't enough room & time to host both over the same weekend.

I've seen a lot of parallels in the explosion of popularity of powerlifting among women, with what I do for my day job. Since 1999 I've worked in the tech industry as a developer. While there have always been female developers (in fact the first programmers were almost exclusively women) the software industry became progressively more male-dominated in the 80s and 90s. Similarly, powerlifting since its inception in the 1970s has been very male-dominated. From the 00s onwards female developers have become more commonplace, and there have been concrete attempts to foster more female-friendly communities in tech and software development. So when I noticed a surge in popularity in powerlifting amongst women at the powerlifting gym I train at, and at GBPF competitions, it felt like similar forces were at work.

I have a lot anecdotal experience of how the tech & software industry has attempted to attract more women. As a veteran female developer I've been asked more than once by my employers how they can get more women to apply for jobs (and, admittedly, I do resent the fact that this seems to be a task given to women, when correcting the gender imbalance in the workplace is EVERYONE'S responsibility). But what about powerlifting? After seven years of lifting and six years of competing, I suppose I am something of a veteran (at least compared to some). Obviously many women are attracted to powerlifting already, but how can you encourage more women to take up the sport and, more importantly, keep coming back?

I have to add a disclaimer here that while I am heavily involved in my gym, I am not the gym owner nor a member of the board. BGWLC is an unusual gym in that is it not a business; instead it is a charity run by a committee of members and I don't actually sit on the committee (through choice). So while I do have a hand in what goes on at the gym, I'm not in any way solely responsible - the gym is a team effort, and all credit has to go to the board of trustees, members and volunteers who make great things happen there.

But whether you're a gym business owner, a volunteer for a sports charity or group, or just someone who attends a gym and cares about what goes on there - if you care about having a more diverse group of people lifting then maybe this article can give you some hints and ideas.

# Encouraging diversity is everyone's responsibility

You can't run a gym for "you and people like you", that's not a business plan
Ask people to moderate the things they say. If they can't, then your gym is not for them

# Your social media presence is key

It's 2016 so most people are going to find out about your gym via your website and social media. In fact I'd say media like Facebook and Instagram are overtaking a website in terms of importance. It's therefore essential that your social media presence projects a friendly and inclusive image.

It might seems like a small thing, but the colours you use for website can be really important. How many gym websites have you seen that are black/red/silver and feature images of snarling wolves or bulldogs? Some people might think they look cool, but to others such aggressive images can be offputting. When I was putting together the BGWLC website, I was keen to use a more "neutral" colour (I used the signature BGWLC green) and feature equal numbers of male & female lifters in the main banner image.

Similarly, on our Instagram account we try to feature women and men equally. This isn't too hard for us as we have a large number of regular female lifters. We also make an effort to not just feature the strongest and most swole lifters, but plenty of beginners and lifters of all shapes and sizes. You might think only featuring the best and strongest lifters makes your gym look like it's the best around, but it can make also less confident & newer lifters think your gym is not a place for them. At the end of the day, your gym needs new members to survive and grow, so you don't want to discourage anyone.

Stay away from gym memes in your professional presence. Memes are hugely popular but they can be hugely problematic. This is especially important when it comes to memes which feature women's bodies in a sexualised manner (doubly so if their heads are cut out of the picture - a woman is more than just her body), memes which disparage people who don't lift (again, these can make new lifters feel they're not welcome) and memes which poke fun at any body type which isn't the swole "ideal". Memes can be fun but they really don't have any place in your professional presence.

Finally, be reactive on social media. People who are curious about trying your gym out might feel too shy to pop in & talk to you about it, or even to talk on the phone. Answer emails or messages on social media promptly, and in a friendly manner. This goes extra if you're responding publicly comments on social media - don't mock or belittle people, and if someone posts a negative comment on one of your pictures or statuses, react in a dignified manner.

# Have decent facilities for women

This might seem like the most basic thing to say but... have women's changing facilities available! I have taken part in powerlifting competitions in venues where there is a men's changing room, but none for women. I also know of one female lifter who is the only woman at her club, and has to change in a Portakabin. It's so simple: have women's facilities and make sure they're kept clean.

Provide sanitary supplies, or set up a Tampon Club (http://www.tampon.club/) among the women at your gym. Hang a mirror in the changing rooms. Put up some hooks for people to hang their gear on. Little things make the biggest differences.
